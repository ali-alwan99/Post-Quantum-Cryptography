# Post-Quantum-Cryptography

Significant innovation has been made in the development of public-key cryptography that is able to withstand quantum attacks, known as post-quantum cryptography (PQC). This project focuses on the development of an efficient PQC hardware implementation. Specifically, an implementation of the binary Ring-learning-with-errors (BRLWE)-based encryption scheme, a promising lightweight PQC suitable for resource-constrained applications, is proposed.

This project is FPGA implementation of Post-Quantum Cryptography written in VHDL. This proposed hardware structure has low implementation complexity suitable for IoT devices and edge computing networks. A diagram illustrating the various components of this algorithmic operation can be seen below.
